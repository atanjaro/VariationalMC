Re-updated metropolis() method to also handle multiple jastrow factors
Changed measure_derivatives() functions to get_derivatives(), and changed measure_local_energy() to get_local_energy(). Any
      instance of measure will mean that the value is tracked in the measurement container
Updated measurement container to separate derivative measurments as it's own sub-container also changed 'global_measurements' to 'expectation', 
      as this makes more sense and will not get confused with the true global value at the end of the simulation

      I'm not sure)
Updated get_local_energy() method, where the Hubbard energy could not be computed due to the aformentioned bug.
measure_ΔkE!() method has beedn debugged and updated.

Check propagation of iterations through the course of all updates.


Change log (06/18):
Fixed get_sr_forces() method, which had previous issue retrieving the local energy.
Fixed parameter_gradient() method, which was incorrectly adding the small variaiton for stabilization. Also fixed issue with the solving of the
      matrix equation required to get the variation of the parameters.
      
With these fixes, the local_fermion_update!() method is now operational!

Upcoming changes:
Need to check acceptance rates of the local fermion update
Need to re-re-check the starting configuration of the simulations i.e. checking that we do not start on the singular configuration.
