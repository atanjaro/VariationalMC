# VariationalMC

This package implements the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method for Hubbard, and electron-phonon interactions, including both Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) style electron-phonon coupling (coming soon).

WARNING! Modules are currently in the developmental phase and are highly experimental. Use at own risk.
